# Machine Learning Demos

A collection of educational Jupyter notebooks exploring Gaussian Processes, Bayesian Optimization, and kernel methods.  
Each notebook implements algorithms from scratch and visualizes predictions, uncertainties, and decision boundaries.

## Notebooks
- **analytical_metropolis_risk_modeling.ipynb** — 1D Gaussian Process regression with Metropolis vs analytical posteriors.  
- **bayesian_optimization_lcb.ipynb** — 1D Bayesian Optimization with Lower Confidence Bound (LCB).  
- **gp_2d_regression.ipynb** — 2D Gaussian Process regression with contour plots.  
- **kernel_logistic_regression_rbf.ipynb** — Kernel logistic regression with RBF kernel on synthetic blob data.
